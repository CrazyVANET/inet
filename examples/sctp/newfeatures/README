This SCTP example contains a small test setup using a dual-homed
environment:
- 5 Clients (#0 to #4) send 10,000 packets to 5 Servers each
- All clients use SACK Immediately, NR-SACK and Packet Drop Reporting
   => NR-SACKs will be used to acknowledge DATA chunks
- Networks have a bit error rate of 10e-6
   => PKTDROPs will be used to report bit errors
- Client #0 applies Add-IP Set Primary at t=10s
   => ASCONF/ASCONF_ACK will be transmitted
- Client #1 uses PR-SCTP (i.e. unreliable transmission)
   => FORWARD_TSNs will be generated

See the omnetpp.ini file for how to configure the new SCTP extensions!



Run the example as follows to print the throughputs of the servers:

./run -u Cmdenv -f omnetpp.ini && \
grep "throughput" scalars.sca | grep newFeaturesTest.serverMain

(This is performed by the run-test-and-display-results script.)



The resulting output should look like this:
...
scalar newFeaturesTest.serverMain[0].sctpApp[0]         throughput      1916071.146545
scalar newFeaturesTest.serverMain[1].sctpApp[0]         throughput      1798230.6879317
scalar newFeaturesTest.serverMain[2].sctpApp[0]         throughput      2014921.5453285
scalar newFeaturesTest.serverMain[3].sctpApp[0]         throughput      1959880.7736224
scalar newFeaturesTest.serverMain[4].sctpApp[0]         throughput      1929689.8109524
